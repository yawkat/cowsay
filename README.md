Cowsay
======

Cowsay plugin for bukkit and bungee.

Usage
-----

`/cowsay <message>`

`/cowthink <message>`

Both commands accept arguments:

- `-p <regex>` sends the message to all players matching that regex.
- `-i` sets the regex to ignore-case.
- `-l` sets the regex to literal mode.
- `-c <color>` changes the color of the cow and the bubble. (for example `-c ยง5`)
- `-s <needle>` replaces the given needle with `ยง` (the minecraft color character) in the text and in the bubble color arg.
- `--` to stop parsing parameters and treat everything following as text

If you end the parameter list with an argumentless parameter like `-i` or `-l` you either have to add an argument that will subsequently ignored or you have to use `--`.
